/* 
Guess-the-number-game: Write a program that pays the game of ‚Äúguess the number‚Äù
as follows: Your program choose the number to be guess by selecting an integer at
random in the range 1 to 1000. The program then displays the following:
a. I have a number between 1 and 1000.
b. Can you guess my number? Please type your first guess.
The player then type a first guess. The program responds with one of the following:
a) Excellent! you guessed the number!
Would like to play again (y or n)?
a) Too low. Try again.
b) Too high. Try again.
If the payer‚Äüs guess is incorrect, your program should loop until the player finally
get the number right. Your program should keep telling the player Too high or Too
low to help the player ‚Äúzero in‚Äù on the correct answer.
